# Router and Dashboard State Taxonomy and Inventory

This document is the canonical inventory for restart-sensitive router and dashboard state.

Use it to answer three questions before adding or changing a stateful feature:

- what kind of state is this
- who owns it
- what durability and recovery behavior users should expect

## State Taxonomy

### `ephemeral_request_state`

- Per-request or per-connection working state that may live only in memory.
- Examples: extproc request context, in-flight streaming buffers, active SSE or WebSocket client maps, short-lived retry state.
- Losing this state on process restart is acceptable.

### `restart_safe_local_state`

- State that should survive a local process restart in one workspace or one node, but does not need to be shared across replicas by default.
- Examples: local-dev bootstrap outputs under `.vllm-sr/`, local auth/evaluation SQLite files, generated runtime config snapshots, local artifact directories.
- This is acceptable for local development and single-node tooling, but it is not a substitute for product durability in multi-user or multi-replica deployments.

### `shared_durable_workflow_state`

- State that users or operators expect to survive restart and remain authoritative across processes, containers, or replicas.
- Examples: user accounts, audit logs, workflow jobs, campaign state, chat history if presented as a product surface, vector-store metadata, file registries, response history, replay history, model-selection learning state.
- This state should live behind a server-owned storage contract, not browser storage or process memory.

### `audit_analytics_telemetry`

- Append-oriented facts about progress, lifecycle, usage, or recovery that operators need for debugging, audits, or reporting.
- Examples: typed workflow events, startup progress records, replay aggregates, deploy history, durable status transitions.
- This is distinct from request-local logs and must not depend on log scraping.

### `derived_projection_state`

- A query-oriented projection derived from a canonical source of truth.
- This state may be rebuilt, but it should still be persisted if operators or the dashboard rely on it.
- Examples: normalized tables for deployed models, signals, decisions, plugins, DSL snapshots, topology views, or current active config version.

## Source Of Truth Rules

- Keep canonical router intent in YAML and DSL, not in a second mutable primary database model.
- If the dashboard needs fast querying, filtering, audit, or joins, create a persisted projection from the active YAML or DSL rather than introducing dual-primary writes.
- Treat `.vllm-sr/` and `dashboard-data/` as local-dev adapters unless a feature is explicitly documented as single-workspace only.
- Keep live connection registries in memory, but move user-visible entities and workflow progress behind durable records.

## Current Inventory

| Surface | Primary owner | Current backend / default | Current durability class | Restart behavior today | Scale risk | Recommended direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Response API stored responses and conversations | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/responsestore/**` | Default `redis`; optional `memory` for local dev only | `shared_durable_workflow_state` | Response and conversation history survives restart when using the default Redis backend. The `memory` backend emits a startup warning and loses all data on restart. | Replica-local only when `memory` is explicitly selected; Redis backend is shared across replicas | Keep metadata and conversation chain in a durable server-owned store by default for product use. Prefer relational storage for metadata and queryability; keep large payloads in blob/object storage only if needed later. |
| Router replay records | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/routerreplay/**`, `src/semantic-router/pkg/extproc/router_replay_setup.go` | Default `postgres`; optional `redis`, `milvus`, `memory` (local dev only) | `audit_analytics_telemetry` with `shared_durable_workflow_state` default | Replay history survives restart when using the default Postgres backend. The `memory` backend emits a startup warning and loses all records on restart. | Postgres provides SQL queryability for audit and compliance. Redis available for lightweight deployments. | Keep metadata and replay records in a durable server-owned store by default. Postgres is the default for long-term audit retention and compliance. Keep Milvus only when semantic replay search is explicitly needed. |
| Semantic cache entries | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/cache/**` | Default `memory`; optional Redis, Milvus, hybrid | `ephemeral_request_state` in local dev; shared cache in scaled deploys | Restart flushes cache; replicas do not share hot entries by default | Cold-start latency, inconsistent cache hit rates, and uneven behavior across replicas | Keep this as cache, not a database table. Prefer Redis or hybrid shared backends for scaled deployments; document memory backend as local/dev or single-node only. |
| RAG retrieval result cache | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/extproc/req_filter_rag_cache.go` | Process-wide singleton in-memory LRU with TTL | `ephemeral_request_state` | Restart flushes cache; cache is global per process, not per tenant or replica | Hidden shared mutable state, no observability, no durability, and no multi-replica coherence | Keep as optional cache only. Move to a pluggable shared cache backend if this becomes performance-critical, or document as local process optimization. |
| Agentic memory vectors | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/memory/**` | Disabled by default; vector content leans on Milvus config when enabled | `shared_durable_workflow_state` when enabled | Depends on backend choice; not enabled by default | Product semantics remain ambiguous between experimental memory and supported user data | Keep vector embeddings in Milvus or another vector store, but pair them with explicit metadata and lifecycle ownership in a durable server-owned contract. |
| Vector store collection registry | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/vectorstore/manager.go` | In-memory `map[string]*VectorStore` | `shared_durable_workflow_state` implemented as process memory | Collection metadata disappears on restart even if backend collections remain | Router can lose inventory and pagination state while backend data still exists | Add a durable metadata registry for vector stores. Keep embeddings in Milvus or Llama Stack, but persist store identity, lifecycle, retention, and counts outside process memory. |
| Vector store file registry | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/vectorstore/filestore.go` | File bytes on local disk; file metadata in memory | Mixed `restart_safe_local_state` and `shared_durable_workflow_state` | Files may remain on disk while metadata vanishes on restart | Orphaned files, missing inventory, poor cleanup and recovery semantics | Persist file metadata and ingestion status in a durable store. Keep large file bytes on disk or object storage, but make metadata authoritative and restart-safe. |
| Startup readiness and model download progress | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/startupstatus/status.go`, `redis_writer.go` | Default `file`; recommended `redis` for production. Router exposes `GET /startup-status` API endpoint for dashboard consumption. | `audit_analytics_telemetry` with `shared_durable_workflow_state` when Redis backend is configured | Status survives restart and is shared across replicas when using the Redis backend. The `file` backend emits a startup warning and is not visible to the dashboard in containerized deployments. The API server starts before model downloads so `/startup-status` is available during the entire boot sequence. | File backend is replica-local and path-dependent; Redis backend is shared across replicas. Dashboard reads from `/startup-status` API first, falling back to file path. Log scraping removed. | Keep Redis as the recommended backend for containerized and multi-replica deployments. The `file` backend remains as a local-dev fallback. Log-parsing fallback has been removed from the dashboard; status resolution uses only the `/startup-status` API and the file path. |
| Model-selection Elo ratings | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/selection/elo.go`, `src/semantic-router/pkg/selection/storage.go` | JSON file autosave when configured; otherwise in-memory | `shared_durable_workflow_state` for learning systems | Defaults to local file or process memory; not replica-safe | Online learning state diverges across replicas and restarts | Persist ratings in a shared durable store when model selection is productized. Local JSON is acceptable only for experiments and local smoke paths. |
| RL-driven selector preferences and session context | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/selection/rl_driven.go` | In-memory maps plus optional file-backed Elo storage for part of the state | Mixed `shared_durable_workflow_state` and `ephemeral_request_state` | Global, user, category, and session preference state is not fully durable or shared | Learning quality and routing behavior drift between replicas; user/session affinity becomes nondeterministic | Define one shared persistence seam for user, category, and session learning state before treating RL selection as production-ready. |
| GMTRouter personalization state | router runtime, `src/semantic-router/pkg/selection/gmtrouter.go` | Local JSON file via `StoragePath` | `shared_durable_workflow_state` implemented as local file | Restart-safe only within one local path; not shared | Multi-instance deployments split personalization state and make recovery manual | Move to a shared durable store or explicitly keep this experimental/local-only. |
| Tools database | router integrations, `global.integrations.tools`, `config/tools_db.json` | JSON file path by default | `restart_safe_local_state` | Survives only as workspace file | Multi-user editing, audit, and HA are weak | If dashboard editing becomes first-class, add a durable metadata store or projection for tools; keep JSON as import/export and local-dev source. |
| Dashboard auth users, roles, permissions, audit logs | dashboard backend auth, `dashboard/backend/auth/store.go` | SQLite at `./data/auth.db` by default | `restart_safe_local_state` | Restart-safe in one workspace, not shared across replicas | Adequate for local stacks, weak for HA or multi-instance deployments | Keep SQLite for local dev. Add a relational production storage seam and move browser auth toward server-owned session handling over time. |
| Browser auth token | dashboard frontend, `dashboard/frontend/src/utils/authFetch.ts` | `localStorage` plus cookie mirroring | `shared_durable_workflow_state` from a user perspective, but browser-owned today | Token persists per browser, not per server policy | Harder revocation, weaker security posture, no server-owned session semantics | Prefer server-owned session contracts for production deployments. If JWT remains, reduce reliance on `localStorage` and document browser-only behavior. |
| Evaluation task metadata | dashboard backend evaluation, `dashboard/backend/evaluation/db.go` | SQLite | `restart_safe_local_state` moving toward `shared_durable_workflow_state` | Tasks survive local restart in one workspace | HA and shared-operator workflows are limited to one mounted DB file | Keep task metadata in relational storage. SQLite is fine for local dev; add a production DB seam for shared deployments. |
| Evaluation progress fanout and cancellation | dashboard handlers, `dashboard/backend/handlers/evaluation.go` | In-memory `sync.Map` of SSE clients and cancel funcs | `ephemeral_request_state` | Active streams and cancel handles vanish on restart | Acceptable for live connections, but status history depends on the DB and in-flight runner state | Keep connection registries in memory, but ensure all progress and terminal states are durable and reconstructable from server-owned records. |
| ML pipeline jobs | dashboard backend ML pipeline, `dashboard/backend/mlpipeline/runner.go`, `dashboard/backend/handlers/mlpipeline.go` | In-memory job map and progress channel; output files on disk | Mixed `shared_durable_workflow_state` and `ephemeral_request_state` | Outputs may survive on disk, but job state and progress vanish on restart | Long-running jobs are not restart-aware; multi-node control is impossible | Move job metadata, lifecycle, and progress into durable workflow tables. Keep SSE client maps in memory only for delivery. |
| Model research campaigns | dashboard backend model research, `dashboard/backend/modelresearch/manager.go` | JSON state files plus in-memory map and event channel | `restart_safe_local_state` | Running campaigns are marked failed after dashboard restart | Campaign recovery semantics are lossy and single-node only | Persist campaign metadata and events in a durable workflow store. Keep artifacts in files/object storage, but make workflow state restart-aware. |
| OpenClaw container registry | dashboard backend OpenClaw, `dashboard/backend/handlers/openclaw.go`, CLI `src/vllm-sr/cli/docker_services.py` | JSON file under OpenClaw data dir | `restart_safe_local_state` | Registry survives in one workspace, not shared across dashboards | Container control depends on local file convention and workspace mounts | Keep this as local-dev adapter for `vllm-sr serve`, but introduce a server-owned registry for multi-user dashboard control. |
| OpenClaw teams and workers | dashboard backend OpenClaw, `dashboard/backend/handlers/openclaw.go`, `openclaw_teams.go`, `openclaw_workers.go` | JSON files under OpenClaw data dir | `shared_durable_workflow_state` implemented as local files | Restart-safe per workspace only | Collaboration semantics, permissions, and audits are weak | Persist team and worker entities in a database. Keep generated config files as derived runtime artifacts, not the only source of truth. |
| OpenClaw rooms and chat messages | dashboard backend OpenClaw, `dashboard/backend/handlers/openclaw_rooms.go` | JSON files rewritten on each append; SSE/WS client maps in memory | `shared_durable_workflow_state` implemented as local files | Restart-safe per workspace only; live client state is ephemeral | Message append path is O(n) per write and unsuitable for large rooms or long histories | Persist room and message metadata in a database. Keep live transport state in memory only. Consider object/blob storage only for large attachments, not message metadata. |
| Dashboard chat history in Playground and similar surfaces | dashboard frontend, `dashboard/frontend/src/hooks/useConversationStorage.ts`, `dashboard/frontend/src/components/ChatComponent.tsx` | Browser `localStorage` | Ambiguous today | Persists only in one browser | No cross-device continuity, no audit, and no server recovery | Decide explicitly: either mark this demo-only and ephemeral, or move conversation state server-side if it is a supported product surface. |
| Config backups, generated runtime config, DSL snapshots | CLI and dashboard, `src/vllm-sr/cli/commands/runtime_support.py`, `dashboard/backend/handlers/config_backups.go`, `dashboard/backend/handlers/runtime_config_sync.go` | Files under `.vllm-sr/` | `restart_safe_local_state` and `derived_projection_state` | Survive in one workspace; not authoritative across deployments | Files blur source-of-truth boundaries and are hard to audit in multi-user setups | Keep YAML and DSL as canonical intent. Add durable version/audit tables plus read-model projections for current models, signals, decisions, plugins, and DSL text. Do not make DB a second mutable primary writer yet. |
| Active deployed models, signals, decisions, plugins, DSL parse results | shared config contract, dashboard topology/config APIs, `src/semantic-router/pkg/config/**`, `src/semantic-router/pkg/dsl/**` | Derived from YAML/DSL at runtime; not stored as durable projection | Missing `derived_projection_state` | Recomputed ad hoc from files and live parse paths | Hard to query, audit, diff, or expose consistently across dashboard and future APIs | Add a persisted projection tied to deployed config version. Suggested projections: active config version, DSL snapshot, models, signals, decisions, plugins, and validation diagnostics. |

## Default Memory-Backed Surfaces To Treat As High Risk

- `global.stores.semantic_cache.backend_type = memory`
- `global.stores.vector_store.backend_type = memory` in dashboard defaults when enabled
- RAG `cache_results` in `src/semantic-router/pkg/config/rag_plugin.go`
- vector-store metadata in `src/semantic-router/pkg/vectorstore/manager.go`
- vector-store file registry in `src/semantic-router/pkg/vectorstore/filestore.go`
- model-selection learning state in `src/semantic-router/pkg/selection/{elo.go,rl_driven.go,gmtrouter.go}`

## What Should Go To A Database First

- User accounts, roles, permissions, and audit logs
- Evaluation, ML pipeline, and model-research job metadata and typed progress events
- OpenClaw teams, workers, rooms, and room messages
- Router-visible metadata for vector stores and uploaded files
- Response API conversations and response metadata if they are exposed as supported product features
- Config version history, active config projection, deployed model/signal/decision/plugin projection, and DSL snapshots

## What Should Prefer Shared Cache Or Specialized Storage Instead Of A Database

- Semantic cache entries: shared cache such as Redis or the existing hybrid cache path
- RAG retrieval cache: shared cache if retained at all
- Vector embeddings and memory embeddings: vector backends such as Milvus or Llama Stack
- Large binary artifacts: local file/object storage with durable metadata in a database

## Progressive Migration Order

1. Publish and keep this inventory current.
2. Make router metadata and replay or response history restart-safe where the product already exposes those surfaces.
3. Move dashboard workflow state off in-memory maps and browser-only storage into server-owned durable records.
4. Add a persisted deployed-config projection so dashboard and future APIs stop reparsing YAML and DSL for every query path.
5. Add restart and recovery coverage in E2E for at least one router state surface and one dashboard workflow. (Response API restart-recovery E2E test added in `e2e/testcases/response_api_restart_recovery.go`, registered in Redis profile.)
